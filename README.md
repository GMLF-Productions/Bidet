Mel Gibson's Patriot Pong Launcher
=====

MGPPL is an automatic ping pong launch that was made using an Arduino. If we had any idea how to put the actual schematics of what we used here we would. It still doesn't work and broke, but it will be finished one way or another.

#### Materials
+ Arduino Uno
+ 2 12v brushless DC fan motors
+ HC-SR04 ultrasonic range detector
+ 12v variable power supply
+ wood for base, metal for ramp
